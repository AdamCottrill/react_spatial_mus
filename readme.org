* Spatial_mus

  Spatial_mus is a react front end to a Django application of the same
  name.  The django application provides an api that returns point
  data with a dynamically specified spatial attribute.  The react
  application provides a means of changing the desired management unit
  and displaying the results on an interactive map.  These
  applications are really nothing more than sandboxes that serve as
  proof of concepts.
